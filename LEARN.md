## This Project was created using NextCord and Heroku
- Nextcord is a Discord-Python API 
- Heroku is a cloud-based software host

Heroku serves the purpose of hosting a discord bot, and this project is a tutorial of how to operate Heroku to host the discord bot. I hope you guys find this useful, and detailed information can be found in the `README.md` file.
